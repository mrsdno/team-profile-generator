  ## Description

*Built using:*
- Node.js®
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

  This is an application that can be used to create a webpage that displays a team's employees and contact information. The inquirer node package is used to prompt the user for information about each team member. Then the file system package is used to generate an html file that dispalys the team's information with links that make it easy to reach out to your team via email. 

  ## Installation

  *To set up this file locally...*

   - Clone this repo to your computer
   - Run `npm i` to install the dependencies

  ## Usage
  
  To start the application: `node index`

  The command line will then prompt a series of questions. Answer the questions as they pertain to the team dashboard you are building.

  Once the prompts are complete, an html file will be created with the information provided in the **/dist** folder. Open the file in the browser to view the new dashboard!
